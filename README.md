See http://jasper07.github.io/openui5-googlemaps/ for online demos.

Contributing
------------
In order to contribute, you'll need to install node.js and npm, its package
manager. Once you've done that, you can install the build time dependencies
(gulp, etc).

    npm install

Once you've changed the source (in `src`), you can build the runtime version

    gulp

This regenerates the assets in `openui5/openui5-googlemaps`.

Create a topic branch for your changes and once they're ready to be merged
upstream, submit a pull request for review.
